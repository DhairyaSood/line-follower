# line-follower
A basic line follower robot simulated in Webots using 9 IR sensors and simple if-else logic. The bot detects a black line on a white surface and adjusts its movement accordingly. This project is ideal for beginners in robotics and simulation, and serves as a stepping stone for real-world implementations using Arduino or similar microcontrollers.
